### Introduce myself
Calling me, Khoi. I'm living at *Ha Noi Capital*. And I'm working as **marketing** agency. I like to explore coding. Because you can make a webiste, mobile application, chatbot,...by writting codes. 

Eg: `this is code block`. It is made by text between `` mark.  

It's so amazing!

And as you know the 5 of 10 biggest company is in technology department. So if you have good a code knowledge, you can hire a good job.

My favorite quote:
> If you can't make it good, at least make it look good.

__Glad to become the partner with all__. Hope to get a respone from you soon!
