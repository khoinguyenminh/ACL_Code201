## About myself
Calling me, Khoi. I'm living at *Ha Noi Capital*. And I'm working as **marketing** agency. I want to become the full-stack developer. Because you would like to make a webiste, mobile application, chatbot,.... 

The coding is so amazing!

Eg: `this is code block`. It was made by text between `` mark.
